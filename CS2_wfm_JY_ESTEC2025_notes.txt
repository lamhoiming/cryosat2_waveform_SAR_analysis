Steps to generate CS2 waveform plots for thin vs thick snow study (for JY - ESTEC presentation on June 30, 2025)
Created on June 20, 2025

1. Search for and download CS2 tracks over ROIs on cs2eo.org 
--- Spatial subset is not possible on the website, the whole tracks have to be downloaded.

2. Subsetting the section of the tracks over the ROIs (see JY's ppt: test site for Ming)
--- For each of the thin and thick snow cases, two tracks were identified and spatially subsetted.
--- Thin snow: 2024-04-11 and 2024-05-22
--- Thick snow 2024-04-06 and 2024-05-19
--- Subsetting was done by python and lat/lon limits of the ROIs (nc_subset.ipynb)

3. Identifying spatial crossovers for thin/thick snow case
--- the subsetted tracks are netcdf files
--- pyhton script first reads the lat/lon of the measurement points along the two tracks in each case
--- round off to 1 decimal place, the closest lat/lon pairs are found
--- the corresponding time of measurement (time_20_ku) are found and the waveforms at these measurement time (and thus lat/lon)

4. Plotting waveforms
--- Waveforms are plotted by the variable "pwr_waveform_20_ku" against the dimension "ns_20_ku", which is the bin number
--- Units are counts scaled to fit in the range 0-65535
--- i.e. the plot shows the tail shape of the waveform, and the vertical scale of each plot is scaled

Results (see pdf)
- For each thin/thick snow case:
-- Left column (blue curves) is the earlier date
-- Right column (green curves) is the later date
-- **Pairs near the middle rows are spatially the nearest**

- thin snow case
-- waveform on the earlier date is generally sharper than the later date
-- on the later date, the tails of the waveforms are wider
-- this could be the influence of wetness in snow on the later date (late May)

- thick case
-- the waveforms and the tails on both dates are similar in shape
